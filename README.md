# Lexicon2AC

We use Source Sans Pro instead of SF Pro in the Analytics Cloud project. 

When pulling in components from the Lexicon library, we would have to go through each text box and change the text style from Lexicon’s to our equivalent text style in Analytics Cloud’s library. And then we would have to do it again every time we swapped an instance. 

A little tedious :grimacing:. 

This plugin simply swaps a Lexicon text style to it’s corresponding Analytics Cloud text style. It can be done for a selected text box or across an entire page in Figma at once.

This plugin isn't available in Figma yet — to use it, please see [Figma's Developer documentation](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/intro/).
